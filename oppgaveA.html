<h1>Pros and cons of working in a group:</h1>
<h2>What type of cases, problems or issues lend themselves to be discussed in groups? <br>
Why not just do it individually?</h2>
<p>When working on creative problem-solving, working in a group is often better. This can be if you are working on a bigger project that requires some “outside-the-box-thinking", and the group dynamic leads to a constructive conversation where different ideas are discussed and put up against each other. When the task requires some discussion, a group will provide a major advantage over individual work, since it's easier to ask and answer questions, as well as requesting some constructive criticism. A group assembly and dynamic can`t be forced upon; it needs to be based on a natural and cohesive goal, which everybody is working together to achieve. 
    Working in a group is also more efficient when the workload is greater, and the different tasks can be done by different people within the group. In the case of planning, the group can provide a major advantage, whether it's regarding projects, working on ideas and reflection, or routines at the workplace and other decisions regarding multiple people.

<h2>Three arguments against working in groups - seen through the eyes of three students:</h2>
<p>Problems with group dynamics can affect results. This can occur either if there are major gaps in personalities, or if there are too little differences, and there is no discussion or different approaches to the problem.<br>
<br>
Laziness; If some members of the group isn`t contributing because they don`t feel like putting in the work to come up with a different idea or approach. This is easier if the groups are too big, and makes it harder to see those who are not contributing.<br> <br>
-	Agreement in the group in regard to their goal and level of ambition. If this doesn`t match, there may be problems later on. </p>   
<h2>Three arguments in favor of working in a small group - seen through the eyes og three students</h2>
<p> Can lead to discussions while working on a project, not just during the planning stage. Discussions, as well as constructive criticism, can contribute to a better end goal. <br> <br>
    Group work leads to input from different members of the group, who can see things from different angles and contain their own different skillsets, which can complement each other. <br> <br>
    It can lead to a greater feeling of responsibility from each of the members because the amount or lack of work they put into the project affects the rest of the group. This leads to an increase in motivation and dedication to the task, and it´s a more social way of handling the task, and can therefore be more fun.
